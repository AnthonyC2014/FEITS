Fire Emblem Fates Text Simulator (Previously called Fire Emblem If Text Simulator)

![FEFTS](/FEFTS/Resources/img/example_conversation_preview.png)

Simulates Fire Emblem Fates conversations, allows for the generation of portraits with specific hair colors, and is generally neat.

== Things that still need to be done ==

- See if the font can be used for the generated text instead of the PNG, for higher-resolution images.

- Implement DLC portraits. Portraits, along with FaceData.bin files, are located in FEFTS\Resources\img\Not_Yet_Used\.
